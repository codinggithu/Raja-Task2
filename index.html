    <p class id="p1">dashed white lines for Smurfit-Stone Container Corp. As was mentioned earlier, Proctor<br>
& Gamble and Nippon Unipac Holding could not be included in this study, and therefore,<br>
Smurfit-Stone Container Corp. rose into the Top Five instead.<br>
An interesting note is that, with the exception of 1995, International Paper, the<br>
largest pulp and paper manufacturer in the world, is consistently found in one of the<br>
poorly performing groups, showing poor performance during most years, particularly<br>
according to profitability ratios.<br>
Georgia-Pacific (GP), the second largest in the world, rose into the Top Five through<br><br>
its acquisition of Fort James in 2000. With exception of 1995 and 1999, GP’s performance<br>
is not very convincing. Profitability is average to poor, and solidity is average. It is,<br>
however, interesting to note that the performance of Georgia-Pacific is very similar to that<br>
of Stora Enso during the years 1995-1997.<br>
Stora Enso (fourth largest) moves from very good in 1995 to downright poor<br>
performance in 1997. The substantial change in position on the map in 1998 was due to<br>
a combination of two factors. The first was decreased profitability due to costs<br>
associated with the merger of Stora and Enso. The second factor was a strengthened<br>
capital structure, which of course further affected profitability ratios like ROE and ROTA.<br>
However, profitability improved again in 1999. Stora Enso was performing excellently in<br>
1995, when pulp prices were high, but profitability fell as market pulp prices dropped. In<br>
2000, however, Stora Enso was among the best performing companies.<br>
As can be expected, the performance of Oji Paper (fifth largest) reflects the Japanese<br>
average and is very poor. This points to the effect of the Asian financial crisis, which is<br>
examined in the next section.<br>
Smurfit-Stone Container Corp., the seventh largest in the world, is consistently a<br>
very poor performer. The company does not move at all during the experiment, being<br>
found in Group E during all years. The company consistently shows low profitability and<br>
liquidity, and very low solidity.<br>
With the notable exception of Stora Enso, performance among the top companies<br>
is very poor, particularly in profitability ratios. In the Top 150 list from 1998 (Matusek et<br>
al., 1999), the Top Five still included Kimberly-Clark and UPM-Kymmene (currently<br>
eighth and ninth). These companies, in particular Kimberly-Clark, are very good perform-<br>ers, as will be shown in later in the chapter. The consolidation of the industry during the<br>
past few years has led to very large, but also largely inefficient companies</p>
<h2>The Impact of the Asian Financial Crisis</h2>
<p class id="p2">During the nineties, the Asian economy was hard hit by the financial crisis. This<br>
means that it will have affected many companies during a long period. However, the peak<br>
of the crisis was during 1997-98 (Corsetti, Pesenti, & Roubini, 1998), and should therefore<br>
show most dramatically during the years 1998 and 1999. As was mentioned in an earlier<br>
discussion, financial information for the year 2000 was very hard to find for Japanese<br>
companies. Therefore, only a few companies could be included for 2000.<br>
Figure 8 illustrates the Japanese companies during the years 1997-99. Movements<br>
by the companies are illustrated using solid white arrows.<br>
The effect of the crisis is obvious on the map. Although Japanese companies<br>
already appear to be performing worse than western companies (as discussed earlier),<br>
the trend towards even worse performance during the years 1998 and 1999 is obvious.</p>
<img src="Task2-img1.jpeg" width=500px height=300px><br>
<p class id="p3">The most dramatic example of this is Daishowa Paper Manufacturing (Company No.<br>
63), which moved from Group A2 (excellent) to Group E (very poor) in three years. The<br>
same can be said, for example, of Nippon Paper Industries (No. 69), Daio Paper (No. 62),<br>
Mitsubishi Paper (No. 67), and Hokuetsu Paper Mills (No. 65), although the effect has<br>
not been as dramatic as for Daishowa Paper Manufacturing. Some companies appear<br>
unaffected and remain in the same node throughout the years 1997-99. Examples of such<br>
companies are Tokai Pulp & Paper (No. 74), Rengo (No. 72), and Chuetsu Paper (No. 64).<br>
The only example of the opposite behavior is Pilot (No. 71, illustrated using solid black<br>
arrows), which improves from Group D in 1998 to Group B in 1999-2000.<br>
It is remarkable that, apart from Pilot, no Japanese company improved its positioning<br>
on the map during the years 1997-99. This is proof of the heavy effect that the crisis has<br>
had on the Japanese economy.</p>
<h2>The Best Performers</h2>
<p class id="p4">In Figure 9, the best performing companies are shown. The criterion for being<br>
selected was that the company could be found in Group A during at least three years<br>
during the period 1995-99.<br>
A number of interesting changes in companies’ positions can be observed on the<br>
map in Figure 9. Some of the companies show a dramatic improvement in performance over<br>
the years. For example, Caraustar Industries (No. 21, solid white arrow) moves from being<br>
in Group E during 1995, to four straight years (1996-99) in Group A2<br>
. Caraustar attributes<br>
this increase to completed acquisitions and lower raw material costs. However, in 2000,<br>
the company drops back into Group D. In its annual report, Caraustar states that this<br>
dramatic decrease in profitability is primarily due to restructuring and other nonrecurring<br>
costs, and also to a certain extent, higher energy costs and lower volumes. Kimberly-Clark<br>
exhibits a similar increase (No. 30, dashed white arrow), moving from the poor end of the</p>
<img src="Task2-img2.jpeg"- width=500px height=300px>
<p class id="p5">map in 1995, to Group A1
 during 1996-99. Kimberly-Clark explains the poor performance<br>
of 1995 with the merger between Kimberly-Clark and Scott Paper Company. The merger<br>
required the sale of several profitable businesses in order to satisfy U.S. and European<br>
competition authorities. The merger also caused a substantial one-time charge of 1,440<br>
million USD, decreasing profitability further. However, profitability was back up again<br>
in 1996, and remained excellent through to 2000. On the other hand, Riverwood Holding<br>
(No. 37, solid black arrow) goes from Group A1
 in 1995-97, to Group A2
 in 1998, and Group<br>
E in 1999-00. This decrease in performance is rather dramatic, and can, according to<br>
Riverwood, be attributed to lower sales volumes in its international folding cartonboard<br>
markets. This was primarily due to weak demand in Asia, and to the effect of the canceling<br>
of a number of low-margin businesses in the U.K.<br>
Some of the consistently best-performing companies include Wausau-Mosinee<br>
Paper (No. 44), Schweitzer-Mauduit Intl (No. 39), Buckeye Technologies (No. 20), UPM-<br>Kymmene (No. 5, dashed black arrows), and Donohue (No. 56, which was acquired by<br>
Abitibi Consolidated in 2000).</p>
<h2>The Poorest Performance</h2>
<p class id="p6">he poorest performing companies are illustrated in Figure 10. The criterion for<br>
being selected was that the company could be found in Group E (the poorest group)<br>
during at least three years.<br>
This map also shows some dramatic movement. Crown Vantage (No. 24, solid black<br>
arrow) is perhaps the most dramatic example; in one year, the company fell from Group<br>
A2
 (1995) to Group E (1996-99). Crown Vantage states in its annual report that the reason<br>
for its poor performance in 1996 is the low price of coated ground-wood paper, and that<br>
when it spun off from James River Corporation (now Fort James) at the end of 1995, Crown</p>
<img src="Task2-img3.jpeg" width=500px height=300px><br>
<p class id="p7">Vantage assumed a large amount of debt. Crown Vantage was unable to pay this debt,<br>
and applied for a Chapter 11 (bankruptcy) on March 15, 2000. Year 2000 data is therefore<br>
not available.<br>
Doman Industries (No. 54, solid white arrows) exhibits similar, through not as<br>
dramatic, behavior. Doman falls from Group B (1995) to settle in Group D or E throughout<br>
the rest of the experiment. According to Doman, this was due to a poor pulp market. In<br>
1997, the market for pulp improved, only to decline again in 1998. Doman cites the Asian<br>
financial crisis as the reason for the second drop, primarily the declining market in Japan.<br>
Temple-Inland (No. 42, dashed white arrow) falls from Group B in 1995 to Group E in 1997,<br>
from where it rises back to Group B in 2000. Temple-Inland states weak demand and<br>
lowered prices for corrugated packaging as the reason for this decline in 1997. An example<br>
of the opposite behavior is Reno de Medici (No. 81, dashed black arrows), which moves<br>
from Group D in 1995, through Group E in 1996, to Group A2 in 1999. However, the<br>
company falls back into Group E in 2000.<br>
A number of companies identified as very poor performers are also illustrated on<br>
the map. These are Crown Vantage (No. 24, solid black arrows), Gaylord Container Corp<br>
(No. 26), Jefferson-Smurfit Corp (No. 29), and Settsu (No. 73).</p>
<h2>CONCLUSIONS</h2>
<p class id="p8">In this study, financial information for 77 companies in the international pulp and<br>
paper industry for the years 1995-2000 was collected using the Internet as a source of<br>
information, and a financial database was created. A number of financial ratios were<br>
selected and calculated based on the information in the database. Then, a data-mining<br>
tool, the self-organizing map, was used to perform a financial competitor benchmarking<br>
of these companies.<br>
<br>
  This tool offers a number of benefits over other alternatives. Using self-organizing<br>
maps, we can compare much larger amounts of data than by using spreadsheet programs.<br>
It is also useful for exploratory data analysis, where patterns are not known a priori. Unlike<br>
traditional clustering methods, like k-means clustering, the number or size of clusters<br>
does not have to be decided a priori, and visualization is much more graphic. A drawback<br>
with self-organizing maps is that the person who runs the analysis has to be an<br>
experienced user of neural networks. Also, like all neural networks, self-organizing maps<br>
are “black boxes,” i.e., the user does not see how the network works or what it does, only<br>
the result. Finally, technical issues, such as standardizing the data, are very important<br>
for the final result.<br>
The results of the study provide further evidence that the self-organizing map is a<br>
feasible and effective tool for financial benchmarking. The results are easy to visualize<br>
and interpret, and provide a very practical way to compare the financial performance of<br>
different companies. The discovered patterns were confirmed with existing domain<br>
    knowledge.</p>
<h2>FUTURE RESEARCH IN THIS AREA</h2>
<p class id="p9">With managers facing increasing amounts of information to process daily, the need<br>
for intelligent tools to perform these operations is likely to increase in the future. This<br>
situation is accentuated by the exponentially increasing amount of information available<br>
through the Internet. We simply cannot cope with this information overload any longer<br>
without using intelligent tools. Therefore, the use of data-mining tools, such as self-<br>organizing maps, is likely to increase dramatically in the future.<br>
In this study, the self-organizing map has been shown to be a feasible tool for<br>
financial benchmarking. The results are easy to visualize and interpret, provide a very<br>
practical way to compare the financial performance of different companies, and could be<br>
used as a complement to traditional net sales comparisons ( Rhiannon, Jewitt, Galasso,<br>
& Fortemps, 2001).<br>
Using this method, an interesting pattern emerges. It is interesting to note that most<br>
of the largest pulp and paper-producing companies in the world, with the exception of<br>
Kimberly-Clark, belong to below-average groups. The ranking shows that the largest<br>
companies according to net sales are not necessarily the best-performing companies. In<br>
fact, the smaller companies appear to utilize their resources much more effectively than<br>
their larger competitors.<br>
As has been shown in several studies (Neural Networks Research Centre, 2001), the<br>
application range for self-organizing maps is virtually limitless, and is certainly not<br>
restricted to use in financial benchmarking. One potentially huge application for self-<br>organizing maps in the future is within Web mining. Web mining is a data-mining<br>
technique for comparing the contents of Web pages in order to provide more accurate<br>
search engines. The possibility of applying neural network technology, called WEBSOM,<br>
to solve this problem is very interesting, and preliminary results are encouraging<br>
(Honkela, Kaski, Lagus, & Kohonen, 1997; Lagus, 2000).</p></body>
